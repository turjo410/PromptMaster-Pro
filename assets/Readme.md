## How to Capture

3. Recommended viewport: **1440x900** for desktop, **375x812** for mobile
4. Use a screenshot tool like **Greenshot**, **ShareX**, or browser's built-in capture
5. Save as `.png` with descriptive filenames
6. Optimize with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before committing

## Tips for Great Screenshots
- Use the dark theme (default)
- Ensure content is fully loaded and animations have settled
- Crop to show just the relevant section, not browser chrome
- Consider adding subtle drop shadows for a polished look
